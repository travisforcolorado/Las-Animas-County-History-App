Moonshiners tucked their stills into the deep ravines of the raton Mesa, producing liquor that flowed into the speakeasies of Trinidad and Pueblo. Enforcing the law here was a deadly assignment.",

In August 1930, he vanished without a trace while patrolling the pass between Trinidad and Raton. Despite massive search parties and federal investigations, his body was never found. Rumors persisted for decades that he had been murdered and his body disposed of in a burning coke oven or an abandoned mine shaft. The case remains one of the West's great unsolved mysteries."
