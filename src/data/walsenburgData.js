            content: "In March 1895, a group of Italian miners were accused of murdering a saloon keeper named Abner Huerfano. Despite a lack of concrete evidence, anti-immigrant sentiment ran high. As the accused men were being transported by law enforcement, they were intercepted by a masked vigilante mob. Four Italians—Stanislaus Vittone, Francesco Ronchietto, Pietro Robero, and Antonio Colorghio—were shot and killed on the roadside.",

It was a humiliating moment for Colorado authorities, proving that they could not—or would not—protect immigrant workers."

            content: "The event deeply scarred the Italian-American community in Trinidad and Walsenburg. It cemented a deep distrust of local authorities and company guards. Miners realized that the legal system offered them no protection. This sentiment would fuel the unionization efforts of the United Mine Workers of America a decade later, directly leading to the armed conflicts of 1913-1914."
