Outnumbered, he fled to a high, rocky butte north of town. Finding a crevice in the rocks, he hid there for days, besieged by the warriors. From his vantage point, he could see the Purgatoire River valley below. He vowed that if he survived, he would make this rugged peak his final resting place.",

His friends and family cut a road up the steep slopes and laid him to rest in a tomb carved out of solid rock. A marble monument marks the spot, inscribed with his name.",
