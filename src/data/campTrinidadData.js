            content: "Located just east of Trinidad, the camp held approximately 3,000 prisoners. While the war raged in Europe, these men spent their days in Colorado. Due to labor shortages, many prisoners were allowed to work on local farms, harvesting sugar beets and beans. This created a strange dynamic where local families worked side-by-side with the enemy.",

            content: "The camp was known for its lax security compared to others, but one event shocked the nation. In 1943, two German officers managed to escape. Their flight was not a solo effort—it was aided by an unlikely source: three Japanese-American sisters from the nearby Amache internment camp."

            heading: "A Treason Trial",
            content: "Tsuruko, Haruko, and Shizuko were American citizens interned at Amache who had been granted work release at a farm near the POW camp. They fraternized with the German officers, and a romance reportedly blossomed. The sisters provided maps, clothes, and supplies for the escape. The officers were recaptured near the Mexican border, and the sisters were put on trial for treason. The incident highlighted the tragic irony of the era: German enemies were often treated with more freedom than loyal American citizens of Japanese descent."
