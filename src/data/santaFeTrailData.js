    intro: "Long before it was a city, Trinidad was a campsite—a crucial pause on the Mountain Branch of the Santa Fe Trail. This commercial highway connected Missouri to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and was the lifeline of the American southwest for decades.",

            content: "Travelers had two choices: the shorter but waterless Cimarron Cutoff, or the Mountain Branch which hugged the Rockies. The Mountain Branch passed directly through the Purgatoire River valley. It was safer from thirst but offered a daunting challenge: the Raton Pass. Trinidad grew as the last stop for travelers to rest and repair their wagons before attempting the grueling climb over the pass.",

Kearney's \"Army of the West\" marched through the future site of Trinidad on their way to seize New Mexico for the United States during the Mexican-American War. The dust from their thousands of boots and hooves marked the end of the Mexican era in the region."

            content: "The trail shaped the very layout of the modern city. Main Street and Commercial Street in downtown Trinidad essentially follow the ruts of the old wagons. Today, you can still see physical traces of the trail in the landscape, a reminder of the thousands of oxen, mules, and pioneers who walked this path seeking fortune and a new life in the West.",
