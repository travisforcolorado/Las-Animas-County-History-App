            content: "The commune is perhaps best known for its architecture. Lacking money for traditional materials, the residents used chopped-up car tops, bottle caps, and scrap metal to construct geodesic domes inspired by Buckminster Fuller. These shimmering, patchwork structures rising from the stark Colorado plains became iconic symbols of the hippie movement.",

            heading: "The End of Utopia",
            content: "Life at Drop City was a radical departure from the norm, with no official leaders and communal ownership. However, the \"Joy Festival\" of 1967 attracted hundreds of visitors, overwhelming the community's resources. The original founders, burnt out by the lack of privacy and the logistical nightmare, eventually moved on (some to found the nearby \"Libre\" commune). By 1973, Drop City was abandoned, but it had sparked a wave of rural communes across the Southwest."
