    subtitle: "An Art Commune on the High Plains",
    intro: "Drop City was a counterculture artists' community that formed near Trinidad, Colorado in 1960 and became known as the first rural \"hippie commune\" in the United States.[1] The community's experiments in art, architecture, and communal living left a lasting cultural imprint on southern Colorado.",

            content: "Drop City began in 1960 when four art students and filmmakers Gene Bernofsky, JoAnn Bernofsky, Richard Kallweit, and Clark Richert bought a seven-acre tract about four miles north of Trinidad.[1] The site sat in Las Animas County, a region better known for ranching and coal than for avant-garde art.[1] The founders intended to create a live-in work of art that extended ideas they had explored at the University of Kansas and the University of Colorado.[1] That goal gave the community its name: the residents would produce \"Drop Art,\" a form of experimental art rooted in the happenings movement and the improvisational performance culture of the 1950s and 1960s.[1] The rural setting offered both isolation and a dramatic canvas for the group's experiments.[1]",

            heading: "Drop Art and Dome Architecture",
            content: "The community became famous for its do-it-yourself architecture. Inspired by Buckminster Fuller and Steve Baer, residents built domes and zonohedra from geometric panels cut out of automobile roofs and other scavenged materials.[1] The structures were inexpensive, experimental, and visually striking, embodying the belief that creativity could transform daily life.[1] By 1967, the core group had grown to around ten people, and that year Drop City won Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion award for its constructions, a high-profile recognition that drew more attention to the commune.[1] These structures were not just shelters; they were a radical design statement on the high plains, intended to merge art and living space into one continuous experiment.[1]"

            heading: "Public Attention and Rising Tension",
            content: "By the mid-1960s, Drop City had become a magnet for visitors from around the world.[1] Media attention, including national television reports, accelerated the commune's growth, especially after the Joy Festival in June 1967 brought hundreds of people to the site.[1] The influx strained the small community and intensified personality conflicts, a challenge noted by founders in later accounts.[1] Although the land was deeded to a nonprofit corporation with a statement that it was \"forever free and open to all people,\" the practical demands of shared life proved difficult.[1] Over time, some of the original residents moved away to start other projects, and the community began to lose cohesion.[1]"

        {
            heading: "Shared Ownership and Social Experiment",
            content: "The founders attempted to formalize a collective ethic by transferring the property to a nonprofit corporation representing the core group.[1] The deed language promised open access and communal ownership, an ideal that reflected the broader counterculture belief in shared resources and voluntary association.[1] In practice, this open-door principle created challenges in maintaining community standards, balancing artistic goals with daily needs, and managing conflict.[1] The steady flow of visitors and short-term residents made cohesion difficult to sustain.[1] Drop City thus became not only an architectural experiment but also a social laboratory testing how a small group could live without traditional hierarchies.[1]"

            heading: "Decline and Legacy",
            content: "Drop City was largely abandoned by 1979, but its influence spread far beyond its short lifespan.[1] The commune became a template for later intentional communities in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico, and former residents helped found other experiments in cooperative living.[1] Libre, for example, was founded by former Droppers near Gardner, Colorado.[1] The bold geometry of its domes also shaped a broader movement in alternative architecture, demonstrating how low-cost materials could be repurposed into expressive design.[1] While the site itself faded, Drop City's reputation as the first rural hippie commune endures, and its story remains one of the most distinctive cultural episodes in Las Animas County history.[1]"
