            content: "In September 1913, over 10,000 miners struck against the Colorado Fuel & Iron Company (CF&I), owned by the Rockefeller family. They demanded basic human rights: an eight-hour workday, the right to shop in independent stores, fair payment for tonnage, and recognition of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA).

When fighting broke out, the militia rained bullets into the tents. Louis Tikas, the Greek leader of the camp, was lured out under a white flag of truce to discuss a ceasefire. Instead, he was pistol-whipped and executed by Lieutenant Karl Linderfelt. The militia then swept through the camp, torching the tents.",

In one such pit, two women and eleven children suffocated and burned to death as the text above them was set ablaze by the National Guard. The death of these innocents sparked the 'Ten Day War,' where enraged miners across the state took up arms against the company guards, seizing mines and controlling the region until federal troops arrived.",
