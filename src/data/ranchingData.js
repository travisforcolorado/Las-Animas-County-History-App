            content: "Long before the railroad, Hispano families from New Mexico settled the Purgatoire Valley in the 1860s. Pioneering figures like Don Felipe Baca and Pedro Valdez established plaza settlements and introduced sheep ranching and irrigation systems (acequias) that are still visible today. Families like the Medinas in Aguilar laid the foundation for the communitys agricultural life.",

The Rourke family founded one of the largest cattle operations in the 1880s, still preserved today as a National Historic District. The McDonald brothers, settling near Weston in 1891, built a legacy that continues with their descendants operating the ranch over a century later.",

Italian families like the Tarabinos and Foghinos established thriving 'truck farms,' growing produce for the bustling coal camps. German settlers formed land companies to encourage farming in the Raton Basin. Their 'mixed farming' approaches helped the region survive when cattle markets fluctuated.",
