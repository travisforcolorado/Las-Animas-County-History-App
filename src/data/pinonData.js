    intro: "The Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site is a 235,896-acre U.S. Army training area in southeastern Colorado established in 1983.[1] Its creation and proposed expansion reshaped ranching communities in Las Animas County and became one of the region's most significant land-use debates.[1]",

            content: "The Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site (PCMS) is a large Army training area located in southeastern Colorado and used primarily by Fort Carson.[1] The Army purchased the land in 1983, using eminent domain for nearly half of the acquisitions because many landowners were unwilling to sell.[1] The site was designed to provide critical maneuver training lands for large-scale exercises, with facilities such as a cantonment area, railhead, helipads, and an airstrip.[1] Exercises can involve thousands of troops and large numbers of tracked and wheeled vehicles moving across the range.[1] From the start, the scale of the project signaled a major shift in how this high plains landscape would be used and managed.[1]",

            content: "The size of PCMS placed it among the largest maneuver training areas in the United States.[1] Ranching and grazing had long defined the surrounding region, but the Army's acquisition introduced a new, federal purpose for the land.[1] The base sits on fragile steppe grasslands where traces of earlier travel, including wagon ruts from the Santa Fe Trail, are still visible in places.[1] This history underscores how the area has served successive waves of movement and labor, from trail travel to ranching to modern military training.[1]",

            content: "In 2003, the Army announced a plan to expand PCMS dramatically by purchasing additional land, much of it owned by ranching families.[1] The proposal sparked organized resistance from local residents and conservation groups who feared further displacement and environmental impacts.[1] Over time, the Army scaled back its expansion plans and faced years of opposition, including congressional bans on funding the project.[1] The debate became a defining civic struggle in southeastern Colorado, often summarized in the local motto \"Not 1 More Acre.\"[1]",

            content: "The Army has described PCMS as a site where environmental protection and training coexist, citing the fragility of steppe grassland and the persistence of wagon ruts from the Santa Fe Trail.[1] In 1991, the Army transferred about 16,000 acres of land in the Purgatoire River Canyon to the Comanche National Grassland for preservation and recreation.[1] The Army has also entered conservation easements in the region, reflecting the broader tension between military use and ecological stewardship.[1] These steps are part of the ongoing effort to manage a landscape that has been used for travel, ranching, and now maneuver training.[1]"

            content: "On November 25, 2013, the U.S. Army canceled its expansion plan for the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site.[1] The decision marked a rare victory for rural communities in a land-use conflict involving federal acquisition and local livelihoods.[1] Even after the cancellation, PCMS remains an active training area, and the Army has highlighted environmental stewardship efforts such as the transfer of land to the Comanche National Grassland and the use of conservation easements.[1] The site continues to symbolize both the scale of modern military training and the resilience of the communities that pushed back.[1]"
