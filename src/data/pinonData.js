    intro: "The Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site has historically been a point of tension between the U.S. Military and the people of Southeastern Colorado. While the initial establishment in 1983 took 235,000 acres, a proposed massive expansion in the 2000s united a diverse coalition of ranchers, environmentalists, and locals in a historic fight to save their land.",

            content: "In 1983, the U.S. Army acquired roughly 235,000 acres of ranchland through eminent domain to create the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site (PCMS) for Fort Carson training. Over half of the land was taken against the will of local owners, leaving deep scars and a legacy of mistrust. Locals were promised there would be no further expansion.",

            content: "In response, the community formed the 'Pinon Canyon Expansion Opposition Coalition' and the 'Not 1 More Acre' group. It was an unprecedented alliance: conservative cattle ranchers stood shoulder-to-shoulder with environmentalists, Native American tribes, and politicians from both parties. They argued that the expansion was unnecessary and destructive.",
