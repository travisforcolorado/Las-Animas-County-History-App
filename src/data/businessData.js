Stone, the paper\'s lineage traces back to the "Enterprise and Chronicle" of 1877, and even earlier to the "Trinidad Enterprise" founded in 1870. As the "paper of record" for Southern Colorado for nearly 150 years, it documented the Wild West, the cattle barons, and played a controversial but pivotal role during the "Coal Field Wars" of 1913-1914.',
